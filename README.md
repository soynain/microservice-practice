# Microservice introduction practice

Hi, welcome to my repo. I'm planning to get into Microservices, the design, programming
and deployment of this services, as the design patterns too, security and more stuff.

It's gonna be ruff :c

This is the initial schema, for now I'll be designing with diagrams the architecture of this stuff,
hands off first, the general architecture of the small system I'm tryna make

Now I have to define the database schemas and the orchestor events with the saga pattern.

For stablishing solid procceses about what I want to do, I'm using use cases so I can set the 
processes that later I'll code, so I dont loose time thinking about what processes to do while
already coding.

# RELATIONAL DATABASES
I decided to try another relational to host user credentials instead of MongoDB as I specified in the arquitecture diagram

# NoSQL DATABASES
It's just one :=P
